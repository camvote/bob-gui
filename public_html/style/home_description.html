<p>Welcome to the <b>Cambridge Student Election System</b>, run by a consortium of College JCRs. 
<br><br>
We use the BoB system which has been used to successfully run thousands of elections for over a decade. BoB is designed for anonymity and security: meaning the admins cannot see who you voted for, and cannot forge votes.</p>
